# Python Code Example: Table of 2

This Python script generates a simple multiplication table for the number 2. 

## Code

```python
# Table of 2
for i in range(1, 10):
    i += 1
    print(f"2 x {i} = {2 * i}")
```

## Explanation

1. **Looping Through Numbers**: The `for` loop iterates through the range of numbers from 1 to 9.
2. **Incrementing the Counter**: Inside the loop, the variable `i` is incremented by 1.
3. **Printing the Multiplication Table**: The `print` function displays the result of multiplying 2 by the updated value of `i`.

**Note:** Due to the increment operation `i += 1`, the table starts from `2 x 2` instead of `2 x 1`.
