## How It Works

1. **Input:** The script first prompts the user to input two numbers and an operator. The numbers are converted to floating-point values for precise arithmetic operations.
2. **Operation Selection:** Based on the operator entered (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), the script performs the corresponding arithmetic operation:
   - `+` for addition
   - `-` for subtraction
   - `*` for multiplication
   - `/` for division
3. **Error Handling:** If the operator is not recognized, the script outputs "Not Found."
4. **Output:** The result of the arithmetic operation is displayed to the user.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter the second number: 3
Result: 8.0
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the operator entered is one of the valid choices (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Be cautious with division by zero, as it will cause a runtime error if the second number is zero.
