## How It Works

1. **Input:** The script first prompts the user to input two numbers and an operator. The numbers are converted to floating-point values for precise arithmetic operations.
2. **Operation Selection:** Based on the operator entered (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), the script performs the corresponding arithmetic operation:
   - `+` for addition
   - `-` for subtraction
   - `*` for multiplication
   - `/` for division
3. **Error Handling:** If the operator is not recognized, the script outputs "Not Found."
4. **Output:** The result of the arithmetic operation is displayed to the user.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter the second number: 3Certainly! Here's a small Markdown file containing the Python code you provided, along with a brief explanation of what it does:

```markdown
# Python Code Example: Table of 2

This Python script generates a simple multiplication table for the number 2. 

## Code

```python
# Table of 2
for i in range(1, 10):
    i += 1
    print(f"2 x {i} = {2 * i}")
```

## Explanation

1. **Looping Through Numbers**: The `for` loop iterates through the range of numbers from 1 to 9.
2. **Incrementing the Counter**: Inside the loop, the variable `i` is incremented by 1.
3. **Printing the Multiplication Table**: The `print` function displays the result of multiplying 2 by the updated value of `i`.

**Note:** Due to the increment operation `i += 1`, the table starts from `2 x 2` instead of `2 x 1`.
```

Result: 8.0
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the operator entered is one of the valid choices (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Be cautious with division by zero, as it will cause a runtime error if the second number is zero.
