# Simple Stopwatch in Python

This is a basic Python script that functions as a simple stopwatch. It measures the elapsed time between two user inputs.

## How It Works

1. **Start**: The script waits for the user to press Enter to start the stopwatch.
2. **Stop**: The script waits for the user to press Enter again to stop the stopwatch.
3. **Calculate**: The script calculates the elapsed time by subtracting the start time from the end time.
4. **Display**: The elapsed time is displayed in seconds.

## Running the Script

1. Save the script to a file, for example, `stopwatch.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved `stopwatch.py`.
4. Run the script using the command: `python stopwatch.py`.
5. Follow the prompts to start and stop the stopwatch.

## Example Output

```
Press Enter to start the stopwatch...
Press Enter to stop the stopwatch...
Elapsed time: 2.345 seconds
```

## Notes

- The elapsed time is measured in seconds and is displayed as a floating-point number.
- Make sure you have Python installed on your machine to run this script.

Feel free to modify and extend the script as needed!
