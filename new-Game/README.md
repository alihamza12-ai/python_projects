# Number Guessing Game

This Python script is a simple number guessing game. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number. The script provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and counts the number of attempts taken by the user.

   ```

## Gameplay

1. The script will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 100.
2. After each guess, it will inform you if your guess is too high or too low.
3. Continue guessing until you correctly identify the number.
4. Once you guess correctly, the script will display the number of attempts it took to guess the number.

## Error Handling

- If the input is not a valid number, the script will prompt you to enter a valid number.

Enjoy the game!
