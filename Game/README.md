# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Description

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python. The user is prompted to enter their choice, and the computer randomly selects one of the three options. The game then determines the winner based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
## Instructions

1. **Run the Code**: Save the code in a file named `rock_paper_scissors.py` and run it using Python.
   
   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```

2. **Play the Game**: Follow the on-screen prompt to enter your choice: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.

3. **Understand the Output**: The game will display your choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the game.

## How It Works

- The code first imports the `random` module to allow the computer to make a random choice.
- The user is asked to input their choice.
- The computer randomly selects one of the choices: rock, paper, or scissors.
- The game compares the user’s choice and the computer’s choice to determine the result:
  - If both choices are the same, it’s a tie.
  - If the user’s choice beats the computer’s choice, the user wins.
  - Otherwise, the computer wins.

## Notes

- Ensure you enter a valid choice: rock, paper, or scissors. Any other input will result in an invalid choice message.
- To improve the game, you can add functionality to handle invalid inputs or allow multiple rounds of play.
